# KACircleCropViewController
An extremely simple circular crop view controller created in Swift, similar in style to the crop controller that Line uses.

# Usage
dsadsadsda

Code converted from Swift to Objective-C. Hopefully others who work in Objective-C will find it useful.

Note that it is possible to use IBInspectables in Objective-C however default values cannot be set. Even if you set them in `initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder` they won’t show in the interface builder. It is better just to set them in the interface builder (i.e. not choosing default and choosing a value or color).

The app uses test data for 7 days of water drinking. It doesn’t actually save the data, just demonstrates some of the features of Core Graphics.

Optimised for iOS8+, iPhone5 - iphone6S+
